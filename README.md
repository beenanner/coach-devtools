## Installation

## Install unpacked version

If you have a problem installing extension from Chrome Store or just want to run latest and hack on it, just clone the repo (say under ~/workspace/coach_panel) and in "Developer mode" Chrome Extensions page select "Load Unpacked extension..." and select "~/workspace/coach_panel/coach_panel".

Use `gulp` to rebuild any changes you make.
