## Installation

Install RailsPanel extension from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/railspanel/gjpfobpafnhjhbajcjgccbbdofdckggg). This is recommended way of installing extension, since it will auto-update on every new version. Note that you still need to update meta_request gem yourself.

## Install unpacked version

If you have a problem installing extension from Chrome Store or just want to run latest and hack on it, just clone the repo (say under ~/workspace/coach_panel) and in "Developer mode" Chrome Extensions page select "Load Unpacked extension..." and select "~/workspace/coach_panel/coach_panel".

## Clearing the Console

You can clear the panel with the usual shortcuts of âŒ˜+k or ctrl+l.
